          <h1>Our Mission</h1>
          <p>
            We are dedicated to securing a digital restoration and re-release of Closet Land (1991), a haunting, allegorical masterpiece by writer-director Radha Bharadwaj. This bold and visually stunning film-once marginalized and misinterpreted-is an urgent meditation on authoritarianism, psychological violence, abuse-related trauma, and the resilience of the human spirit.
            Closet Land is not just a film—it is a courageous act of artistic resistance, created by a woman with a culturally diverse background, working outside the traditional expectations placed upon underrepresented artists. The film fearlessly employs metaphor, minimalism, and impressionistic abstraction to explore themes of oppression and inner survival.
            Its exclusion from the conversation is not just a cinematic blind spot—it's a failure to confront power, pain, and resilience in art.
          </p>
          <p>
            Closet Land was truly ahead of its time. When it first premiered, many critics didn't know what to make of it. They struggled to grasp its bold intensity — finding it unsettling, disorienting, and deeply disturbing. Yet it resonated with people on a profoundly subconscious level.
            Once seen, it's never forgotten — which is why the film continues to inspire a loyal and growing following to this day.
          </p>
          <p>
            We invite you to join us in urging the rights holders to restore Closet Land for digital distribution, physical media releases, and access for film studies—because we believe that film restoration is not just about rescuing a work of art from physical decay; it is an act of preserving artistic legacy.

          <h1>Synopsis</h1>
          <p>
            Closet Land is a harrowing, allegorical psychological drama set in an unnamed totalitarian state. A young children's book author (played by Madeleine Stowe) is taken from her home and interrogated by a government agent (played by Alan Rickman), who accuses her of embedding subversive political messages in her work. Over the course of a single night in a stark, windowless room, the agent uses psychological manipulation, intimidation, and torture to force a confession. As the interrogation intensifies, the woman's resilience and imagination become her only means of resistance.
            Written and directed by Radha Bharadwaj, Closet Land is a powerful exploration of authoritarianism, censorship, and the enduring strength of the human spirit.
